            <h4>The Culture</h4>

            <article>
                <p> We strongly believe there's always an opportunity to learn from each other outside of day-to-day
                    work, whether it's company-wide offsites, internal hackathons, or co-worker meetups. We always value
                    cross-team collaboration and diversity of thought, no matter the job title.</p>
